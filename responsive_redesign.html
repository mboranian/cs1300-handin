        <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p class="response">The goal of this assignment is to practice the
            workflow of redesigning a simple website. You should take away the skills
            necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, create
            low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and
            build a responsive website based on those prototypes.</p>
        <h3>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h3>
        <p class="response">In this portion of the project I identified an axisting Webpage
            that I thought had areas for improvement. I outline these areas below. Part 1
            also consists of analysing the output from the WebAIM WAVE tool that helps identify
            accessibility issues in a given website.

        <div id="part1" class="section">
            <h4 class="responseHeader">Chosen Website: Campus Fine Wines</h4>
            <img class="screenshot" id="originalScreenshot" src="assets/OriginalCFW.png"
                alt="Screenshot of original Campus Fine Wines Webpage">
            <a href="https://www.campusfinewines.com" target=”_blank”>Original Website</a>
            <h4 id="response1header" class="responseHeader">Why I chose this Website</h4>
            <p id="response1" class="response">I chose this website because at first glance it seems pretty solid, but
                upon closer inspection, it is quite confusing and messy; there are many
                categories inherent to this business, and yet they are not placed front
                and center.</p>
            <h4 class="responseHeader">Observations about usability using the criteria we learned about in class</h4>
            <ul class="response">
                <li>It is clear how to use the website but it could be clearer</li>
                <li>All primary functions of the website shoved into one drop down menu</li>
                <li>Should feature options prominently</li>
                <li>Moving visuals on the website that do not need to be there</li>
                <li>Some things look clickable but are not</li>
                <li>Strange Tags section at bottom of page</li>
                <li>Compare function is present but very easy to miss and unclear how to use</li>
                <li>Inefficient because all tasks require multiple clicks</li>
                <li>Compare feature does not work</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="responseHeader">Critique of WebAIM WAVE Analysis</h4>
            <p class="response">In general the problems found by WAVE had to
                do mostly with empty links, html structure errors like skipped
                headers and missing labels. These things are not immediately
                apparent to the naked eye, but are important. One large issue
                is the large amount of low contrast text on the page. This is
                noticeable and is a bit annoying. It is usable for the average eye,
                but is definitely not accessible.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h3>
        <p class="response">In the next portion of the project, my personal redesign of the chosen webpage takes place.
            Starting with speed sketches to brainstorm and moving through low fidelity wireframes to high fidelity
            mockups, I produce what I believe is a design that improves upon the original webpage.

        <h3>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h3>
        <p class="response">In the final part of the project I produce a responsive webpage using HTML and CSS in the
            style of my high fidelity mockups. It can be viewed on any device, and deals with the design issues I
            identified
            in part 1. Functional elements of the webpage have been replaced with dummy elements for the purpose of this
            assignment.
